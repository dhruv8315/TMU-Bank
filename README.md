We have created an Online Banking System using Jforms for the frontend, Java for the Backend and MySql for the database. 
The software allows the user to create an account, make cheque deposits, Interac/Transfer funds to another person, Pay bills and also Check their transaction history. 
We used ApacheNetBeans to develop UI, IntelliJ to code for the backend and MySQL Workbench to create Databases.

### MySQL database setup
There is one sql scripts provided, it will create the database and create the tables.

databaseSetup.sql will create the tables, so the user can register themselves.
